# Voice Recoginition app using Flutter

It is an Android Appliaction which captures user input using voice and translates it to text and then play the converted text back as audio. The voice should be natural in hindi/or any other language

I have used Built in library for the speech to text conversion i.e. speech_to_text: ^6.6.1 and text to speech flutter_tts: ^4.0.1
